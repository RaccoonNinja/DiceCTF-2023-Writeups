# DiceCTF-2023-Writeups
Original write-ups from :raccoon::ninja: on DiceCTF 2023.

I joined the team ~9h after the start.
I played web for the most part as it is the only part I'm more confident in (besides baby challs and guessy misc ~~and hint elicitation, at which I'm pro~~)
I really enjoyed the web challs, though Scorescope doesn't feel like web.

### Solved challenges that I took part:
- Scorescope
- Codebox

## Reflections

As expected, this CTF is hard. The challenges are very fair though and I definitely learned new things :smile:.
I'm too caught up in getting some result - probably need some change in mentality and be a better ~~burp~~ collaborator.
~~I think I established my role as a hint elicitor as well.~~
